# Simon-Game-Master

WELCOME TO MY REPOSITORY

-> SIMON GAME is a mini project created using HTML, CSS, JavaScript adn Jquery.

-> This is a part of my full stack web development course on Udemy by Anjela U

-> I have used advanced Javascript DOM and jquery

HOW TO PLAY:

-> Press Enter on keyboard to Start
-> The Game gives you a pattern of button clicks by pressing and playing unique sounds of each button

-> You need to repplicate the pattern after each button press from the system

-> When you succeed, your level increases.

-> If you fail the game is over.

-> But hey don't worry, you can restart the game by again pressing Enter key on your keyboard.
